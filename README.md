# Simple OpenGL 3D program
![demo gif](demo.gif)

You can adjust the light's position and color in this 3D scene and fly around inside the scene. Educational purpose only.

## ðŸŽ®&#xFE0F; Controls
- <kbd>WASD</kbd> and Mouse : move around
- <kbd>Left Control</kbd> : descend
- <kbd>Space</kbd> : ascend
- <kbd>F1</kbd> : toggle between ImGUI window and scene.
- <kbd>F2</kbd> : toggle between light's depth map and scene.
- <kbd>F5</kbd> : reload `shader.vert, shader.frag` and recompile that shdaer program.

## âš &#xFE0F; Important Stuffs
- You need to provide your local version of `vcpkg.cmake` and replace the path of `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` in `CMakePresets.json`
- Uses `cl.exe` for compiler (Visual C++)
- I worked with Visual Studio Code's CMake extension and stuffs. They are pretty handy since they let you interact with CMake project with GUI. Following are extensions in Visual Studio Code.
    - `CMake`
    - `CMake Language Support`
    - `CMake Tools`
    - `C/C++ Extension Pack`
